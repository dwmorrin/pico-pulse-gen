# Pico Pulse Generator

Using the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to produce programmable pulses, suitable for
modular synthesizers.

- 8 programmable steps (expandable)
- 3 programmed outputs (expandable)
- clock output
- internal tempo control via analog pot
- read/write mode to transfer patterns between outputs
  - write mode transfers from the 8 programming buttons to the selected output
  - read mode transfers from the selected output to the 8 programming buttons

Adds rhythmic variation to any module that takes a gate/trigger/clock input.

The multiple, synchronized outputs make simple drum programming easy.
